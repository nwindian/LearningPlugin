# Memorization Plugin
This is a index card/memorization plugin for Obsidian. It currently implements a spaced repetition algorithm based off of SuperMemo-2(think Anki).

## How to Use
Currently, this plugin allows you to study by tag. To study a tag, click the Memorization plugin icon on the left pane or select it from the command palette, search for a tag, and the plugin will generate study notes for you.

## Settings
### Delete memorization notes after creation
By default, this plugin will create and store new study notes for you. This could be annoying for some people, so disable this setting if that's the case.

### Enable creation of new tabs
By default, when you go to the next note in the sequence, a new tab is not created. Enable this if you\'d like a new tab created.
